We are looking for an excellent Front End Developer specifically well versed in Angular, Typescript, and CSS. We've been in business for 6 years, we service over 350 wineries, and are generating enough revenue to sustain the company and grow indefinitely. Revenue continues to grow every year.\n\nWe are a large remote team of 12, with folks residing in SF, Napa, Portland, New York, Winnipeg, San Diego, Washington. Our employees contribute significant work to the platform remotely, from ski cabins in Tahoe to Brooklyn apartments. You'll have the freedom to set your own hours and work wherever pleases you, although we will meet up occasionally in the Bay Area and Portland. We plan for two trips a year where the full team gets together to discuss product, brainstorm, cook, and drink really expensive wine. Don't worry if your palate is atrocious -- us engineers still struggle with it after all these years.\n\nIn terms of engineering problems, we are in a fascinating space. The domain has many unique and novel problems to solve. We frequently visit beautiful wineries to understand their challenges and then deliver tangible solutions for their operations. We are a team of friends and professionals who thoroughly enjoy what we do.\n\nOur current goals are to optimize data capture for our wineries, which includes storing their extensive analytics, integrating with hardware sensing companies, modeling complex winemaking activities, tracking costs, and furthering our slick digital work order platform.\n\nTechnical details & requirements:\nYou will be focused on advancing our critical Angular + AngularJS web application. In fact, you will take eventually take ownership of this codebase, managing all future development, making foundational changes to the platform, and continuously working on bug fixes.\n\nYou must be a master at AngularJS and Angular 2+ and have used, hopefully extensively, the ng-upgarde module to use AngularJS components within an Angular app, and vice versa. You'll be an excellent candidate if you stay up on all things Angular. Do you know what Ivy is? Are you excited about PWAs? Do you swear by Typescript? RxJS?\n\nYour time will be spent on new feature development as well as the continued migration of our AngularJS codebase to Angular, all while working closely with our winemakers and product development team to implement the business logic that runs our web app.\n\nYou Should Have Extensive Experience And Knowledge Of:\n—  Angular & AngularJS.\n— CSS\n— SAS. \n— RESTful API Development for web applications \n— Webpack\n— All the other obvious ones like git that come with modern web app development.\n\nOur tech stack:\n— Python/Django back end \n — PostgreSQL DB  \n— Google cloud engine \n—  AngularJS & Angular4 web app \n— Native iOS app (available on the app store) \n— NGINX  \n— Bitbucket managed continuous deployment for all platforms\n\nYou'll be reporting to the CTO (me!) and will become my right-hand human. This is a full-time role with a preference for people on the west coast, but we are fully open to anywhere in North America.

Learn to Code, Change the World.  \n\ncupertino.thecoderschool.com\n\nJob Summary\n\n\ntheCoderSchool Cupertino is looking for passionate Code Coaches to teach our next generation how to change the world!  You will meet incredible kids, teach them how to code (and how to think like a coder!), and be rewarded with an amazing experience.  This is a part-time position for 2-25 hours/week (same times weekly), depending on your schedule.  Our open hours will be generally 3-8pm on select weekdays and 10am-2pm on Saturdays.\n\nWe will provide Instructor Training, and will use more of a teaching methodology than a curriculum.  Much of our teaching will be reverse-engineering games or concepts, and will adapt to a particular student's interests and skills.\n\n\n\n\nResponsibilities \n\nA Code Coach is a mentor who teaches kids how to code.  At theCoderSchool, we have two basic teaching styles - your assignment will depend on schedule, ability, and desire.\n\n\n1. Private and Semi-Private Tutoring.  One-to-one or one-to-few coding lessons for kids.  Typically in Scratch/Snap for the younger folks, with Python or Javascript/HTML or Java, C++ and beyond for the advanced kids.\n\n2. Code Class.  Traditional curriculum based classes with a larger student to teacher ratio.\n\nThis position rocks because you will:\n - Meet, mentor, and grow amazing kids who are excited to learn, and potentially manage a team of kids to create an application. \n - Meet and communicate with parents - many of whom will be techies themselves, who work at some of the best companies and startups in the Bay Area.\n - Give back to the community and help grow our next generation by sharing your knowledge of technology\n\n\nRequirements\n\nWhat do we want from you?  Read on.\n - PASSION.  All caps!  This is all about giving back to the kids. We need to see goose bumps when your student ROCKS a code challenge.\n - Great Communicator.  There will be plenty of chatting with parents, and of course patience is a virtue when it comes to kids!\n - Street Cred.  Our college-level Code Coaches will have Comp Sci or Engineering or similar major at a nearby accredited school.  Our Veteran Code Coaches will have relevant industry experience.\n - Coding Skills.  Strong grasp of basic procedural programming.  General knowledge of other languages is assumed - Javascript, PHP, HTML/CSS, Python, Java are most helpful.  Deep technical skills aren't required - we prefer you communicate well and find answers along with students than know everything upfront.\n- Teaching Experience.  Experience teaching kids in any subject is a plus, as is experience with Scratch or Snap.\n\nSound awesome?  Shoot us your resume!

You will meet incredible kids, teach them how to code (and how to think like a coder!), and be rewarded with an amazing experience.  This is a part-time position for 2-25 hours/week (same times weekly), depending on your schedule.  Our open hours will be generally 3-8pm on select weekdays and 10am-2pm on saturdays.\n\nWe will provide Instructor Training, and will use more of a ìteaching methodologyî than a curriculum.  Much of our teaching will be reverse-engineering games or concepts, and will adapt to a particular student's interests and skills.\n\n\n\n\nResponsibilities \n\nA Code Coach is a mentor who teaches kids how to code.  At theCoderSchool, we have two basic teaching styles - your assignment will depend on schedule, ability, and desire.\n\n\n1. Private and Semi-Private Tutoring.  One-to-one or one-to-few coding lessons for kids.  Typically in Scratch/Snap for the younger folks, with Python or Javascript/HTML or Java, C++ and beyond for the advanced kids.\n\n2. Code Class.  Traditional curriculum based classes with a larger student to teacher ratio.\n\nThis position rocks because you will:\n - Meet, mentor, and grow amazing kids who are excited to learn, and potentially manage a team of kids to create an application. \n - Meet and communicate with parents - many of whom will be techies themselves, who work at some of the best companies and startups in the Bay Area.\n - Give back to the community and help grow our next generation by sharing your knowledge of technology\n\n\nRequirements\n\nWhat do we want from you?  Read on.\n - PASSION.  All caps!  This is all about giving back to the kids. We need to see goose bumps when your student ROCKS a code challenge.\n - Great Communicator.  There will be plenty of chatting with parents, and of course patience is a virtue when it comes to kids!\n - Street Cred.  Our college-level Code Coaches will have Comp Sci or Engineering or similar major at a nearby accredited school.  Our Veteran Code Coaches will have relevant industry experience.\n - Coding Skills.  Strong grasp of basic procedural programming.  General knowledge of other languages is assumed - Javascript, PHP, HTML/CSS, Python, Java are most helpful.  Deep technical skills aren't required - we prefer you communicate well and find answers along with students than know everything upfront.\n- Teaching Experience.  Experience teaching kids in any subject is a plus, as is experience with Scratch or Snap.\n\nSound awesome?  Shoot us your resume!
